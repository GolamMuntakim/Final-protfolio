	</div>
	<p className=" text-white">React is an open-source JavaScript library used for frontend development, which was developed by Facebook. Its component-based library lets you build high-quality user-interfaces for web apps. This library allows you to place HTML code inside JavaScript and it works with Virtual DOM. There are many reason why we should use it in frontend . such as <br />
1/ React is easy to learn and that is one of the most important reasons to choose this library. As it doesn’t take much time to learn this technology, you can quickly become a React developer. Unlike Angular, it’s not a complex tool. The learning process becomes easier when you have great JavaScript skills. <br />
2/ React lets you build rich user-interfaces easily. Quality of user-interfaces is important because a poorly designed user-interface is generally less user-friendly and the users will not like a poorly designed UI. <br />
3/ You can increase your productivity by using the reusable components and development tools. Developer’s productivity is important because if you can get things done quickly. 
There are many development tools available for React which speed up work. For example, there’s a browser extension called React Developer Tools. <br />
4/ One of the biggest reasons why you should choose React for frontend development is that it has a very strong community support. A large community of React developers is making it better as it’s an open-source library and coders from around the world are helping people learn the technology in different ways. <br />
5/ Compared to other frontend frameworks, the React code is easier to maintain and is flexible due to its modular structure. <br />
6/ React JS was designed to provide high performance in mind. The core of the framework offers a virtual DOM program and server-side rendering, which makes complex apps run extremely fast. <br />
7/ One of the main benefits of using React JS is its potential to reuse components. It saves time for developers as they don’t have to write various codes for the same features. Furthermore, if any changes are made in any particular part, it will not affect other parts of the application. <br />
8/It is easy to learn react native if we know react and that's why we can build web app and mobile app using react only.
So, now that you know the key benefits of the React framework.</p>
